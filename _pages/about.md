I am a final-year PhD student in the <a href="https://magrilab.ae.ic.ac.uk/">Magrilab</a> at the Department of  <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/aeronautics/">Aeronautics</a> at Imperial College London. 

I specialize in time series forecasting, machine learning, and nonlinear dynamics. My work primarily focuses on data-driven reduced-order modeling for chaotic partial differential equations, with recent projects leveraging convolutional autoencoders and echo state networks to analyze stability in high-dimensional systems. 

I am currently learning about data assimilation techniques and extreme events - send me a message if you are keen on discussing science and beyond.
