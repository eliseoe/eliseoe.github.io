This is a maple pecan pie without corn syrup, less sweet than usual.

## Ingredients
- 1 pie crust (I recommend [Preppy Kitchen](https://preppykitchen.com/classic-pastry-crust/))

### Filling
- 3 eggs
- 250g maple syrup
- 1.5 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1 tbsp flour
- a pinch of salt
- 72g butter, melted and slightly cooled 

- 250g pecans
- whipped cream (optional)

## Preparation
1. Preheat the oven to 175˚C (fan). 
2. Roll out the pie crust and lay it out in your pie dish. Brush with egg wash (optional) and freeze it for 20 minutes, otherwise the crust will shrink.
3. Blind bake: After 20 minutes, take the pie crust out of the freezer. Lay down some parchment paper. Fill it with pie weights or ~300g sugar (can be used in other recipes.) Bake for 15 minutes at 175. 
4. Add the pecans to a tray and roast them simultaneously with the pie crust. I recommend 10 minutes at 175.
5. Prepare your filling: Whisk the butter and flour together. Add the vanilla extract, salt, eggs, and maple syrup until combined. 
6. When the pecans are roasted, chop approx ~200g and lay them on the pre-baked pie crust. Pour over the filling. Lay additional pecans for decoration.

5. Bake for 45–50 minutes and enjoy!
