## Ingredients

- 3 eggs
- 190g caster sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla sugar or extract
- 225g plain flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 150ml milk
- 75g butter, melted

### For the topping:
- 100g butter (I use lightly salted)
- 150g desiccated coconut
- 200g dark brown sugar
- 75ml whole milk


## Preparation

1. Preheat the oven to 175˚C (fan). Grease and line a 9"/ 24cm round cake tin.
2. Whisk the eggs, caster sugar, and vanilla on high speed for several minutes, until the mixture turns pale and light.
3. In a separate bowl, sift the flour and baking powder together.
4. Gently fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture. Slowly fold the warm (not hot) butter in, then the milk until just incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin.
5. Bake for 35–40 minutes, or until almost fully cooked, depending on the size of your tin (avoid opening the oven door in the first 20 minutes). 
6. For the topping, melt the butter, coconut, brown sugar, milk, and a pinch of salt together in a saucepan about 10 minutes before the cake finishes Step 5.
7. Remove the cake from the oven just before it is fully baked. Spread the topping evenly over the cake, then return it to the oven. Increase the heat to 200˚C and bake for an additional 5 minutes.


## Equipment

- 23–25 cm round cake tin or equivalent rectangular tin (20 x 32 cm) — adjust baking time accordingly.
